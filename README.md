# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version - 2.5.1

* Database initialization 

* How to run the test suite

The program needs the gems included in the gemfile
in order to install the gems needed, run "bundle install".

Wait until the installation finishes.

After the installation, run "rake db:migrate".

Lastly, run "rails s" to start the rails server.

Don't forget to close the server by pressing "Ctrl + C"
